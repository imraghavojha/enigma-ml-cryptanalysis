# Enigma ML Cryptanalysis

Machine learning approach to break Enigma cipher settings.

## Overview
This project uses ML to predict Enigma rotor positions from ciphertext,
reducing brute force search space by 10,000x.

## Setup
- Requires: Python 3.8+, C++ Enigma simulator
- Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Progress
- [ ] Data generation pipeline
- [ ] Feature extraction
- [ ] Model training
- [ ] Integration with C++ simulator
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
